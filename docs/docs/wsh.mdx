# wsh command

The `wsh` command is always available from Wave blocks. It is a powerful tool for interacting with Wave blocks and can bridge data between your CLI and the widget GUIs.

---

## view

You can open a preview block with the contents of any file or directory by running:

```
wsh view [path]
```

You can use this command to easily preview images, markdown files, and directories. For code/text files this will open
a codeedit block which you can use to quickly edit the file using Wave's embedded graphical editor.

---

## edit

```
wsh edit [path]
```

This will open up codeedit for the specified file. This is useful for quickly editing files on a local or remote machine in our graphical editor. This command will wait until the file is closed before exiting (unlike \`view\`) so you can set your \`$EDITOR\` to \`wsh editor\` for a seamless experience. You can combine this with a \`-m\` flag to open the editor in magnified mode.

---

## getmeta

You can view the metadata of any block or tab by running:

```
# get the metadata for the current terminal block
wsh getmeta

# get the metadata for block num 2 (see block numbers by holidng down Ctrl+Shift)
wsh getmeta -b 2

# get the metadata for a blockid (get block ids by right clicking any block header "Copy Block Id")
wsh getmeta -b [blockid]

# get the metadata for a tab
wsh getmeta -b tab

# dump a single metadata key
wsh getmeta [-b [blockid]] [key]

# dump a set of keys with a certain prefix
wsh getmeta -b tab "bg:*"

# dump a set of keys with prefix (and include the 'clear' key)
wsh getmeta -b tab --clear-prefix "bg:*"
```

This is especially useful for preview and web blocks as you can see the file or url that they are pointing to and use that in your CLI scripts.

blockid format:

- `this` -- the current block (this is also the default)
- `tab` -- the id of the current tab
- `d6ff4966-231a-4074-b78a-20acc7226b41` -- a full blockid is a UUID
- `a67f55a3` -- blockids may be truncated to the first 8 characters
- `5` -- if a number less than 100 is given, it is a block number. blocks are numbered sequentially in the current tab from the top-left to bottom-right. holding <Kbd k="Ctrl:Shift"/> will show a block number overlay.

---

## setmeta

You can update any metadata key value pair for blocks (and tabs) by using the setmeta command. The setmeta command takes the same `-b` arguments as getmeta.

```
wsh setmeta -b [blockid] [key]=[value]
wsh setmeta -b [blockid] file=~/myfile.txt
wsh setmeta -b [blockid] url=https://waveterm.dev/

# set the metadata for the current tab using the given json file
wsh setmeta -b tab --json [jsonfile]

# set the metadata for the current tab using a json file read from stdin
wsh setmeta -b tab --json
```

You can get block and tab ids by right clicking on the appropriate block and selecting "Copy BlockId" (or use the block number via Ctrl:Shift). When you
update the metadata for a preview or web block you'll see the changes reflected instantly in the block.

Other useful metadata values to override block titles, icons, colors, themes, etc.

Here's a complex command that will copy the background (bg:\* keys) from one tab to the current tab:

```
wsh getmeta -b [other-tab-id] "bg:*" --clear-prefix | wsh setmeta -b tab --json -
```

---

## ai

Send messages to new or existing AI blocks directly from the CLI. `-f` passes a file. note that there is a maximum size of 10k for messages and files, so use a tail/grep to cut down file sizes before passing. The `-f` option works great for small files though like shell scripts or `.zshrc` etc.

By default the messages get sent to the first AI block (by blocknum). If no AI block exists, then a new one will be created. Use `-n` to force creation of a new AI block. Use `-b` to target a specific AI block.

```
wsh ai "how do i write an ls command that sorts files in reverse size order"
wsh ai -f <(tail -n 20 "my.log") -- "any idea what these error messages mean"
wsh ai -f README.md "help me update this readme file"

# creates a new AI block
wsh ai -n "tell me a story"

# targets block number 5
wsh ai -b 5 "tell me more"
```

---

## editconfig

You can easily open up any of Wave's config files using this command.

```
wsh editconfig [config-file-name]

# opens the default settings.json file
wsh editconfig

# opens presets.json
wsh editconfig presets.json

# opens widgets.json
wsh editconfig widgets.json
```

---

## deleteblock

```
wsh deleteblock -b [blockid]
```

This will delete the block with the specified id.

---

## ssh

```
wsh ssh [user@host]
```

This will use Wave's internal ssh implementation to connect to the specified remote machine.

---

## wsl

```
wsh wsl [-d <distribution name>]
```

This will connect to a WSL distribution on the local machine. It will use the default if no distribution is provided.

---

## web

You can search for a given url using:

```
wsh web <url>
```

Alternatively, you can search with the configured search engine using:

```
wsh web <search query>
```

Both of these commands will open a new web block with the desired page.

---

## conn

This has several subcommands which all perform various features related to connections.

### status

```
wsh conn status
```

This command gives the status of all connections made since waveterm started.

### reinstall

For ssh connections,

```
wsh conn reinstall [user@host]
```

For wsl connections,

```
wsh conn reinstall [wsl://<distribution name>]
```

This command reinstalls the Wave Shell Extensions on the specified connection.

### disconnect

For ssh connections,

```
wsh conn disconnect [user@host]
```

For wsl connections,

```
wsh conn disconnect [wsl://<distribution name>]
```

This command completely disconnects the specified connection. This will apply to all blocks where the connection is being used

### connect

For ssh connections,

```
wsh conn connect [user@host]
```

For wsl connections,

```
wsh conn connect [wsl://<distribution name>]
```

This command connects to the specified connection but does not create a block for it.

### ensure

For ssh connections,

```
wsh conn ensure [user@host]
```

For wsl connections,

```
wsh conn ensure [wsl://<distribution name>]
```

This command connects to the specified connection if it isn't already connected.

---

### setconfig

```
wsh setconfig [config name]=[config value]
```

This allows setting various options in the `config/settings.json` file. It will check to be sure a valid config option was provided.
