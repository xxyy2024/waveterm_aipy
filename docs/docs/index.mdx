# Welcome to Wave Terminal

Wave is an [open-source](https://github.com/wavetermdev/waveterm) terminal that adds the ability to launch graphical widgets, controlled and integrated directly with the CLI. We support MacOS, Linux, and Windows ([Downloads](https://waveterm.dev/download)).

Wave isn't just another terminal emulator; it's a rethink on how terminals are built. For too long there has been a disconnect between the CLI and the web. If you want fast, keyboard-accessible, easy-to-write applications, you use the CLI, but if you want graphical interfaces, native widgets, copy/paste, scrolling, variable font sizes, then you'd have to turn to the web. Wave's goal is to bridge that gap.
